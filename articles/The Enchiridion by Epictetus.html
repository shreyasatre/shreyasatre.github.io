<a name="10"></a><b>1.</b> Some things are in our control and others not. Things in our 
<a name="11"></a>control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever 
<a name="12"></a>are our own actions. Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, 
<a name="13"></a>command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own 
<a name="14"></a>actions.
<a name="15"></a><br><br>The things in our control are by nature free, unrestrained, unhindered; 
<a name="16"></a>but those not in our control are weak, slavish, restrained, belonging to 
<a name="17"></a>others. Remember, then, that if you suppose that things which are slavish 
<a name="18"></a>by nature are also free, and that what belongs to others is your own, then 
<a name="19"></a>you will be hindered. You will lament, you will be disturbed, and you will 
<a name="20"></a>find fault both with gods and men. But if you suppose that only to be your 
<a name="21"></a>own which is your own, and what belongs to others such as it really is, 
<a name="22"></a>then no one will ever compel you or restrain you. Further, you will find 
<a name="23"></a>fault with no one or accuse no one. You will do nothing against your will. 
<a name="24"></a>No one will hurt you, you will have no enemies, and you not be 
<a name="25"></a>harmed.
<a name="26"></a><br><br>Aiming therefore at such great things, remember that you must not 
<a name="27"></a>allow yourself to be carried, even with a slight tendency, towards the 
<a name="28"></a>attainment of lesser things. Instead, you must entirely quit some things 
<a name="29"></a>and for the present postpone the rest. But if you would both have these 
<a name="30"></a>great things, along with power and riches, then you will not gain even 
<a name="31"></a>the latter, because you aim at the former too: but you will absolutely 
<a name="32"></a>fail of the former, by which alone happiness and freedom are 
<a name="33"></a>achieved.
<a name="34"></a><br><br>Work, therefore to be able to say to every harsh appearance, "You 
<a name="35"></a>are but an appearance, and not absolutely the thing you appear to be." 
<a name="36"></a>And then examine it by those rules which you have, and first, and chiefly, 
<a name="37"></a>by this: whether it concerns the things which are in our own control, or 
<a name="38"></a>those which are not; and, if it concerns anything not in our control, be 
<a name="39"></a>prepared to say that it is nothing to you.
<a name="40"></a><br><br><b>2.</b> Remember that following desire promises the attainment 
<a name="41"></a>of that of which you are desirous; and aversion promises the avoiding that 
<a name="42"></a>to which you are averse. However, he who fails to obtain the object of 
<a name="43"></a>his desire is disappointed, and he who incurs the object of his aversion 
<a name="44"></a>wretched. If, then, you confine your aversion to those objects only which 
<a name="45"></a>are contrary to the natural use of your faculties, which you have in your 
<a name="46"></a>own control, you will never incur anything to which you are averse. But 
<a name="47"></a>if you are averse to sickness, or death, or poverty, you will be wretched. 
<a name="48"></a>Remove aversion, then, from all things that are not in our control, and 
<a name="49"></a>transfer it to things contrary to the nature of what is in our control. 
<a name="50"></a>But, for the present, totally suppress desire: for, if you desire any of 
<a name="51"></a>the things which are not in your own control, you must necessarily be disappointed; 
<a name="52"></a>and of those which are, and which it would be laudable to desire, nothing 
<a name="53"></a>is yet in your possession. Use only the appropriate actions of pursuit 
<a name="54"></a>and avoidance; and even these lightly, and with gentleness and 
<a name="55"></a>reservation.
<a name="56"></a><br><br><b>3.</b> With regard to whatever objects give you delight, are 
<a name="57"></a>useful, or are deeply loved, remember to tell yourself of what general 
<a name="58"></a>nature they are, beginning from the most insignificant things. If, for 
<a name="59"></a>example, you are fond of a specific ceramic cup, remind yourself that it 
<a name="60"></a>is only ceramic cups in general of which you are fond. Then, if it breaks, 
<a name="61"></a>you will not be disturbed. If you kiss your child, or your wife, say that 
<a name="62"></a>you only kiss things which are human, and thus you will not be disturbed 
<a name="63"></a>if either of them dies.
<a name="64"></a><br><br><b>4.</b> When you are going about any action, remind yourself 
<a name="65"></a>what nature the action is. If you are going to bathe, picture to yourself 
<a name="66"></a>the things which usually happen in the bath: some people splash the water, 
<a name="67"></a>some push, some use abusive language, and others steal. Thus you will more 
<a name="68"></a>safely go about this action if you say to yourself, "I will now go bathe, 
<a name="69"></a>and keep my own mind in a state conformable to nature." And in the same 
<a name="70"></a>manner with regard to every other action. For thus, if any hindrance arises 
<a name="71"></a>in bathing, you will have it ready to say, "It was not only to bathe that 
<a name="72"></a>I desired, but to keep my mind in a state conformable to nature; and I 
<a name="73"></a>will not keep it if I am bothered at things that happen.
<a name="74"></a><br><br><b>5.</b> Men are disturbed, not by things, but by the principles 
<a name="75"></a>and notions which they form concerning things. Death, for instance, is 
<a name="76"></a>not terrible, else it would have appeared so to Socrates. But the terror 
<a name="77"></a>consists in our notion of death that it is terrible. When therefore we 
<a name="78"></a>are hindered, or disturbed, or grieved, let us never attribute it to others, 
<a name="79"></a>but to ourselves; that is, to our own principles. An uninstructed person 
<a name="80"></a>will lay the fault of his own bad condition upon others. Someone just starting 
<a name="81"></a>instruction will lay the fault on himself. Some who is perfectly instructed 
<a name="82"></a>will place blame neither on others nor on himself.
<a name="83"></a><br><br><b>6.</b> Don't be prideful with any excellence that is not your 
<a name="84"></a>own. If a horse should be prideful and say, " I am handsome," it would 
<a name="85"></a>be supportable. But when you are prideful, and say, " I have a handsome 
<a name="86"></a>horse," know that you are proud of what is, in fact, only the good of the 
<a name="87"></a>horse. What, then, is your own? Only your reaction to the appearances of 
<a name="88"></a>things. Thus, when you behave conformably to nature in reaction to how 
<a name="89"></a>things appear, you will be proud with reason; for you will take pride in 
<a name="90"></a>some good of your own.
<a name="91"></a><br><br><b>7.</b> Consider when, on a voyage, your ship is anchored; if 
<a name="92"></a>you go on shore to get water you may along the way amuse yourself with 
<a name="93"></a>picking up a shellfish, or an onion. However, your thoughts and continual 
<a name="94"></a>attention ought to be bent towards the ship, waiting for the captain to 
<a name="95"></a>call on board; you must then immediately leave all these things, otherwise 
<a name="96"></a>you will be thrown into the ship, bound neck and feet like a sheep. So 
<a name="97"></a>it is with life. If, instead of an onion or a shellfish, you are given 
<a name="98"></a>a wife or child, that is fine. But if the captain calls, you must run to 
<a name="99"></a>the ship, leaving them, and regarding none of them. But if you are old, 
<a name="100"></a>never go far from the ship: lest, when you are called, you should be unable 
<a name="101"></a>to come in time.
<a name="102"></a><br><br><b>8.</b> Don't demand that things happen as you wish, but wish 
<a name="103"></a>that they happen as they do happen, and you will go on 
<a name="104"></a>well.
<a name="105"></a><br><br><b>9.</b> Sickness is a hindrance to the body, but not to your 
<a name="106"></a>ability to choose, unless that is your choice. Lameness is a hindrance 
<a name="107"></a>to the leg, but not to your ability to choose. Say this to yourself with 
<a name="108"></a>regard to everything that happens, then you will see such obstacles as 
<a name="109"></a>hindrances to something else, but not to yourself.
<a name="110"></a><br><br><b>10.</b> With every accident, ask yourself what abilities you 
<a name="111"></a>have for making a proper use of it. If you see an attractive person, you 
<a name="112"></a>will find that self-restraint is the ability you have against your desire. 
<a name="113"></a>If you are in pain, you will find fortitude. If you hear unpleasant language, 
<a name="114"></a>you will find patience. And thus habituated, the appearances of things 
<a name="115"></a>will not hurry you away along with them.
<a name="116"></a><br><br><b>11.</b> Never say of anything, "I have lost it"; but, "I have 
<a name="117"></a>returned it." Is your child dead? It is returned. Is your wife dead? She 
<a name="118"></a>is returned. Is your estate taken away? Well, and is not that likewise 
<a name="119"></a>returned? "But he who took it away is a bad man." What difference is it 
<a name="120"></a>to you who the giver assigns to take it back? While he gives it to you 
<a name="121"></a>to possess, take care of it; but don't view it as your own, just as travelers 
<a name="122"></a>view a hotel.
<a name="123"></a><br><br><b>12.</b> If you want to improve, reject such reasonings as these: 
<a name="124"></a>"If I neglect my affairs, I'll have no income; if I don't correct my servant, 
<a name="125"></a>he will be bad." For it is better to die with hunger, exempt from grief 
<a name="126"></a>and fear, than to live in affluence with perturbation; and it is better 
<a name="127"></a>your servant should be bad, than you unhappy.
<a name="128"></a><br><br>Begin therefore from little things. Is a little oil spilt? A little 
<a name="129"></a>wine stolen? Say to yourself, "This is the price paid for equanimity, for tranquillity, 
<a name="130"></a>and nothing is to be had for nothing." When you call your servant, it is 
<a name="131"></a>possible that he may not come; or, if he does, he may not do what you want. 
<a name="132"></a>But he is by no means of such importance that it should be in his power 
<a name="133"></a>to give you any disturbance.
<a name="134"></a><br><br><b>13.</b> If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish 
<a name="135"></a>and stupid with regard to external things. Don't wish to be thought to 
<a name="136"></a>know anything; and even if you appear to be somebody important to others, 
<a name="137"></a>distrust yourself. For, it is difficult to both keep your faculty of choice 
<a name="138"></a>in a state conformable to nature, and at the same time acquire external 
<a name="139"></a>things. But while you are careful about the one, you must of necessity 
<a name="140"></a>neglect the other.
<a name="141"></a><br><br><b>14.</b> If you wish your children, and your wife, and your friends 
<a name="142"></a>to live for ever, you are stupid; for you wish to be in control of things 
<a name="143"></a>which you cannot, you wish for things that belong to others to be your 
<a name="144"></a>own. So likewise, if you wish your servant to be without fault, you are 
<a name="145"></a>a fool; for you wish vice not to be vice," but something else. But, if 
<a name="146"></a>you wish to have your desires undisappointed, this is in your own control. 
<a name="147"></a>Exercise, therefore, what is in your control. He is the master of every 
<a name="148"></a>other person who is able to confer or remove whatever that person wishes 
<a name="149"></a>either to have or to avoid. Whoever, then, would be free, let him wish 
<a name="150"></a>nothing, let him decline nothing, which depends on others else he must 
<a name="151"></a>necessarily be a slave.
<a name="152"></a><br><br><b>15.</b> Remember that you must behave in life as at a dinner 
<a name="153"></a>party. Is anything brought around to you? Put out your hand and take your 
<a name="154"></a>share with moderation. Does it pass by you? Don't stop it. Is it not yet 
<a name="155"></a>come? Don't stretch your desire towards it, but wait till it reaches you. 
<a name="156"></a>Do this with regard to children, to a wife, to public posts, to riches, 
<a name="157"></a>and you will eventually be a worthy partner of the feasts of the gods. 
<a name="158"></a>And if you don't even take the things which are set before you, but are 
<a name="159"></a>able even to reject them, then you will not only be a partner at the feasts 
<a name="160"></a>of the gods, but also of their empire. For, by doing this, Diogenes, Heraclitus 
<a name="161"></a>and others like them, deservedly became, and were called, 
<a name="162"></a>divine.
<a name="163"></a><br><br><b>16.</b> When you see anyone weeping in grief because his son 
<a name="164"></a>has gone abroad, or is dead, or because he has suffered in his affairs, 
<a name="165"></a>be careful that the appearance may not misdirect you. Instead, distinguish 
<a name="166"></a>within your own mind, and be prepared to say, "It's not the accident that 
<a name="167"></a>distresses this person., because it doesn't distress another person; it 
<a name="168"></a>is the judgment which he makes about it." As far as words go, however, 
<a name="169"></a>don't reduce yourself to his level, and certainly do not moan with him. 
<a name="170"></a>Do not moan inwardly either.
<a name="171"></a><br><br><b>17.</b> Remember that you are an actor in a drama, of such a 
<a name="172"></a>kind as the author pleases to make it. If short, of a short one; if long, 
<a name="173"></a>of a long one. If it is his pleasure you should act a poor man, a cripple, 
<a name="174"></a>a governor, or a private person, see that you act it naturally. For this 
<a name="175"></a>is your business, to act well the character assigned you; to choose it 
<a name="176"></a>is another's.
<a name="177"></a><br><br><b>18.</b> When a raven happens to croak unluckily, don't allow 
<a name="178"></a>the appearance hurry you away with it, but immediately make the distinction 
<a name="179"></a>to yourself, and say, "None of these things are foretold to me; but either 
<a name="180"></a>to my paltry body, or property, or reputation, or children, or wife. But 
<a name="181"></a>to me all omens are lucky, if I will. For whichever of these things happens, 
<a name="182"></a>it is in my control to derive advantage from it."
<a name="183"></a><br><br><b>19.</b> You may be unconquerable, if you enter into no combat 
<a name="184"></a>in which it is not in your own control to conquer. When, therefore, you 
<a name="185"></a>see anyone eminent in honors, or power, or in high esteem on any other 
<a name="186"></a>account, take heed not to be hurried away with the appearance, and to pronounce 
<a name="187"></a>him happy; for, if the essence of good consists in things in our own control, 
<a name="188"></a>there will be no room for envy or emulation. But, for your part, don't 
<a name="189"></a>wish to be a general, or a senator, or a consul, but to be free; and the 
<a name="190"></a>only way to this is a contempt of things not in our own 
<a name="191"></a>control.
<a name="192"></a><br><br><b>20.</b> Remember, that not he who gives ill language or a blow 
<a name="193"></a>insults, but the principle which represents these things as insulting. 
<a name="194"></a>When, therefore, anyone provokes you, be assured that it is your own opinion 
<a name="195"></a>which provokes you. Try, therefore, in the first place, not to be hurried 
<a name="196"></a>away with the appearance. For if you once gain time and respite, you will 
<a name="197"></a>more easily command yourself.
<a name="198"></a><br><br><b>21.</b> Let death and exile, and all other things which appear 
<a name="199"></a>terrible be daily before your eyes, but chiefly death, and you win never 
<a name="200"></a>entertain any abject thought, nor too eagerly covet 
<a name="201"></a>anything.
<a name="202"></a><br><br><b>22.</b> If you have an earnest desire of attaining to philosophy, 
<a name="203"></a>prepare yourself from the very first to be laughed at, to be sneered by 
<a name="204"></a>the multitude, to hear them say,." He is returned to us a philosopher all 
<a name="205"></a>at once," and " Whence this supercilious look?" Now, for your part, don't 
<a name="206"></a>have a supercilious look indeed; but keep steadily to those things which 
<a name="207"></a>appear best to you as one appointed by God to this station. For remember 
<a name="208"></a>that, if you adhere to the same point, those very persons who at first 
<a name="209"></a>ridiculed will afterwards admire you. But if you are conquered by them, 
<a name="210"></a>you will incur a double ridicule.
<a name="211"></a><br><br><b>23.</b> If you ever happen to turn your attention to externals, 
<a name="212"></a>so as to wish to please anyone, be assured that you have ruined your scheme 
<a name="213"></a>of life. Be contented, then, in everything with being a philosopher; and, 
<a name="214"></a>if you wish to be thought so likewise by anyone, appear so to yourself, 
<a name="215"></a>and it will suffice you.
<a name="216"></a><br><br><b>24.</b> Don't allow such considerations as these distress you. 
<a name="217"></a>"I will live in dishonor, and be nobody anywhere." For, if dishonor is 
<a name="218"></a>an evil, you can no more be involved in any evil by the means of another, 
<a name="219"></a>than be engaged in anything base. Is it any business of yours, then, to 
<a name="220"></a>get power, or to be admitted to an entertainment? By no means. How, then, 
<a name="221"></a>after all, is this a dishonor? And how is it true that you will be nobody 
<a name="222"></a>anywhere, when you ought to be somebody in those things only which are 
<a name="223"></a>in your own control, in which you may be of the greatest consequence? "But 
<a name="224"></a>my friends will be unassisted." -- What do you mean by unassisted? They 
<a name="225"></a>will not have money from you, nor will you make them Roman citizens. Who 
<a name="226"></a>told you, then, that these are among the things in our own control, and 
<a name="227"></a>not the affair of others? And who can give to another the things which 
<a name="228"></a>he has not himself? "Well, but get them, then, that we too may have a share." 
<a name="229"></a>If I can get them with the preservation of my own honor and fidelity and 
<a name="230"></a>greatness of mind, show me the way and I will get them; but if you require 
<a name="231"></a>me to lose my own proper good that you may gain what is not good, consider 
<a name="232"></a>how inequitable and foolish you are. Besides, which would you rather have, 
<a name="233"></a>a sum of money, or a friend of fidelity and honor? Rather assist me, then, 
<a name="234"></a>to gain this character than require me to do those things by which I may 
<a name="235"></a>lose it. Well, but my country, say you, as far as depends on me, will be 
<a name="236"></a>unassisted. Here again, what assistance is this you mean? "It will not 
<a name="237"></a>have porticoes nor baths of your providing." And what signifies that? Why, 
<a name="238"></a>neither does a smith provide it with shoes, or a shoemaker with arms. It 
<a name="239"></a>is enough if everyone fully performs his own proper business. And were 
<a name="240"></a>you to supply it with another citizen of honor and fidelity, would not 
<a name="241"></a>he be of use to it? Yes. Therefore neither are you yourself useless to 
<a name="242"></a>it. "What place, then, say you, will I hold in the state?" Whatever you 
<a name="243"></a>can hold with the preservation of your fidelity and honor. But if, by desiring 
<a name="244"></a>to be useful to that, you lose these, of what use can you be to your country 
<a name="245"></a>when you are become faithless and void of shame.
<a name="246"></a><br><br><b>25.</b> Is anyone preferred before you at an entertainment, 
<a name="247"></a>or in a compliment, or in being admitted to a consultation? If these things 
<a name="248"></a>are good, you ought to be glad that he has gotten them; and if they are 
<a name="249"></a>evil, don't be grieved that you have not gotten them. And remember that 
<a name="250"></a>you cannot, without using the same means [which others do] to acquire things 
<a name="251"></a>not in our own control, expect to be thought worthy of an equal share of 
<a name="252"></a>them. For how can he who does not frequent the door of any [great] man, 
<a name="253"></a>does not attend him, does not praise him, have an equal share with him 
<a name="254"></a>who does? You are unjust, then, and insatiable, if you are unwilling to 
<a name="255"></a>pay the price for which these things are sold, and would have them for 
<a name="256"></a>nothing. For how much is lettuce sold? Fifty cents, for instance. If another, 
<a name="257"></a>then, paying fifty cents, takes the lettuce, and you, not paying it, go 
<a name="258"></a>without them, don't imagine that he has gained any advantage over you. 
<a name="259"></a>For as he has the lettuce, so you have the fifty cents which you did not 
<a name="260"></a>give. So, in the present case, you have not been invited to such a person's 
<a name="261"></a>entertainment, because you have not paid him the price for which a supper 
<a name="262"></a>is sold. It is sold for praise; it is sold for attendance. Give him then 
<a name="263"></a>the value, if it is for your advantage. But if you would, at the same time, 
<a name="264"></a>not pay the one and yet receive the other, you are insatiable, and a blockhead. 
<a name="265"></a>Have you nothing, then, instead of the supper? Yes, indeed, you have: the 
<a name="266"></a>not praising him, whom you don't like to praise; the not bearing with his 
<a name="267"></a>behavior at coming in.
<a name="268"></a><br><br><b>26.</b> The will of nature may be learned from those things 
<a name="269"></a>in which we don't distinguish from each other. For example, when our neighbor's 
<a name="270"></a>boy breaks a cup, or the like, we are presently ready to say, "These things 
<a name="271"></a>will happen." Be assured, then, that when your own cup likewise is broken, 
<a name="272"></a>you ought to be affected just as when another's cup was broken. Apply this 
<a name="273"></a>in like manner to greater things. Is the child or wife of another dead? 
<a name="274"></a>There is no one who would not say, "This is a human accident." but if anyone's 
<a name="275"></a>own child happens to die, it is presently, "Alas I how wretched am I!" 
<a name="276"></a>But it should be remembered how we are affected in hearing the same thing 
<a name="277"></a>concerning others.
<a name="278"></a><br><br><b>27.</b> As a mark is not set up for the sake of missing the 
<a name="279"></a>aim, so neither does the nature of evil exist in the 
<a name="280"></a>world.
<a name="281"></a><br><br><b>28.</b> If a person gave your body to any stranger he met on 
<a name="282"></a>his way, you would certainly be angry. And do you feel no shame in handing 
<a name="283"></a>over your own mind to be confused and mystified by anyone who happens to 
<a name="284"></a>verbally attack you?
<a name="285"></a><br><br><b>29.</b> In every affair consider what precedes and follows, 
<a name="286"></a>and then undertake it. Otherwise you will begin with spirit; but not having 
<a name="287"></a>thought of the consequences, when some of them appear you will shamefully 
<a name="288"></a>desist. "I would conquer at the Olympic games." But consider what precedes 
<a name="289"></a>and follows, and then, if it is for your advantage, engage in the affair. 
<a name="290"></a>You must conform to rules, submit to a diet, refrain from dainties; exercise 
<a name="291"></a>your body, whether you choose it or not, at a stated hour, in heat and 
<a name="292"></a>cold; you must drink no cold water, nor sometimes even wine. In a word, 
<a name="293"></a>you must give yourself up to your master, as to a physician. Then, in the 
<a name="294"></a>combat, you may be thrown into a ditch, dislocate your arm, turn your ankle, 
<a name="295"></a>swallow dust, be whipped, and, after all, lose the victory. When you have 
<a name="296"></a>evaluated all this, if your inclination still holds, then go to war. Otherwise, 
<a name="297"></a>take notice, you will behave like children who sometimes play like wrestlers, 
<a name="298"></a>sometimes gladiators, sometimes blow a trumpet, and sometimes act a tragedy 
<a name="299"></a>when they have seen and admired these shows. Thus you too will be at one 
<a name="300"></a>time a wrestler, at another a gladiator, now a philosopher, then an orator; 
<a name="301"></a>but with your whole soul, nothing at all. Like an ape, you mimic all you 
<a name="302"></a>see, and one thing after another is sure to please you, but is out of favor 
<a name="303"></a>as soon as it becomes familiar. For you have never entered upon anything 
<a name="304"></a>considerately, nor after having viewed the whole matter on all sides, or 
<a name="305"></a>made any scrutiny into it, but rashly, and with a cold inclination. Thus 
<a name="306"></a>some, when they have seen a philosopher and heard a man speaking like Euphrates 
<a name="307"></a>(though, indeed, who can speak like him?), have a mind to be philosophers 
<a name="308"></a>too. Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature 
<a name="309"></a>is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your 
<a name="310"></a>back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. 
<a name="311"></a>Do you think that you can act as you do, and be a philosopher? That you 
<a name="312"></a>can eat and drink, and be angry and discontented as you are now? You must 
<a name="313"></a>watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must 
<a name="314"></a>quit your acquaintance, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by those 
<a name="315"></a>you meet; come off worse than others in everything, in magistracies, in 
<a name="316"></a>honors, in courts of judicature. When you have considered all these things 
<a name="317"></a>round, approach, if you please; if, by parting with them, you have a mind 
<a name="318"></a>to purchase equanimity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, don't come here; 
<a name="319"></a>don't, like children, be one while a philosopher, then a publican, then 
<a name="320"></a>an orator, and then one of Caesar's officers. These things are not consistent. 
<a name="321"></a>You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your 
<a name="322"></a>own ruling faculty or externals, and apply yourself either to things within 
<a name="323"></a>or without you; that is, be either a philosopher, or one of the 
<a name="324"></a>vulgar.
<a name="325"></a><br><br><b>30.</b> Duties are universally measured by relations. Is anyone 
<a name="326"></a>a father? If so, it is implied that the children should take care of him, 
<a name="327"></a>submit to him in everything, patiently listen to his reproaches, his correction. 
<a name="328"></a>But he is a bad father. Is you naturally entitled, then, to a good father? 
<a name="329"></a>No, only to a father. Is a brother unjust? Well, keep your own situation 
<a name="330"></a>towards him. Consider not what he does, but what you are to do to keep 
<a name="331"></a>your own faculty of choice in a state conformable to nature. For another 
<a name="332"></a>will not hurt you unless you please. You will then be hurt when you think 
<a name="333"></a>you are hurt. In this manner, therefore, you will find, from the idea of 
<a name="334"></a>a neighbor, a citizen, a general, the corresponding duties if you accustom 
<a name="335"></a>yourself to contemplate the several relations.
<a name="336"></a><br><br><b>31.</b> Be assured that the essential property of piety towards 
<a name="337"></a>the gods is to form right opinions concerning them, as existing "I and 
<a name="338"></a>as governing the universe with goodness and justice. And fix yourself in 
<a name="339"></a>this resolution, to obey them, and yield to them, and willingly follow 
<a name="340"></a>them in all events, as produced by the most perfect understanding. For 
<a name="341"></a>thus you will never find fault with the gods, nor accuse them as neglecting 
<a name="342"></a>you. And it is not possible for this to be effected any other way than 
<a name="343"></a>by withdrawing yourself from things not in our own control, and placing 
<a name="344"></a>good or evil in those only which are. For if you suppose any of the things 
<a name="345"></a>not in our own control to be either good or evil, when you are disappointed 
<a name="346"></a>of what you wish, or incur what you would avoid, you must necessarily find 
<a name="347"></a>fault with and blame the authors. For every animal is naturally formed 
<a name="348"></a>to fly and abhor things that appear hurtful, and the causes of them; and 
<a name="349"></a>to pursue and admire those which appear beneficial, and the causes of them. 
<a name="350"></a>It is impractical, then, that one who supposes himself to be hurt should 
<a name="351"></a>be happy about the person who, he thinks, hurts him, just as it is impossible 
<a name="352"></a>to be happy about the hurt itself. Hence, also, a father is reviled by 
<a name="353"></a>a son, when he does not impart to him the things which he takes to be good; 
<a name="354"></a>and the supposing empire to be a good made Polynices and Eteocles mutually 
<a name="355"></a>enemies. On this account the husbandman, the sailor, the merchant, on this 
<a name="356"></a>account those who lose wives and children, revile the gods. For where interest 
<a name="357"></a>is, there too is piety placed. So that, whoever is careful to regulate 
<a name="358"></a>his desires and aversions as he ought, is, by the very same means, careful 
<a name="359"></a>of piety likewise. But it is also incumbent on everyone to offer libations 
<a name="360"></a>and sacrifices and first fruits, conformably to the customs of his country, 
<a name="361"></a>with purity, and not in a slovenly manner, nor negligently, nor sparingly, 
<a name="362"></a>nor beyond his ability.
<a name="363"></a><br><br><b>32.</b> When you have recourse to divination, remember that 
<a name="364"></a>you know not what the event will be, and you come to learn it of the diviner; 
<a name="365"></a>but of what nature it is you know before you come, at least if you are 
<a name="366"></a>a philosopher. For if it is among the things not in our own control, it 
<a name="367"></a>can by no means be either good or evil. Don't, therefore, bring either 
<a name="368"></a>desire or aversion with you to the diviner (else you will approach him 
<a name="369"></a>trembling), but first acquire a distinct knowledge that every event is 
<a name="370"></a>indifferent and nothing to you., of whatever sort it may be, for it will 
<a name="371"></a>be in your power to make a right use of it, and this no one can hinder; 
<a name="372"></a>then come with confidence to the gods, as your counselors, and afterwards, 
<a name="373"></a>when any counsel is given you, remember what counselors you have assumed, 
<a name="374"></a>and whose advice you will neglect if you disobey. Come to divination, as 
<a name="375"></a>Socrates prescribed, in cases of which the whole consideration relates 
<a name="376"></a>to the event, and in which no opportunities are afforded by reason, or 
<a name="377"></a>any other art, to discover the thing proposed to be learned. When, therefore, 
<a name="378"></a>it is our duty to share the danger of a friend or of our country, we ought 
<a name="379"></a>not to consult the oracle whether we will share it with them or not. For, 
<a name="380"></a>though the diviner should forewarn you that the victims are unfavorable, 
<a name="381"></a>this means no more than that either death or mutilation or exile is portended. 
<a name="382"></a>But we have reason within us, and it directs, even with these hazards, 
<a name="383"></a>to the greater diviner, the Pythian god, who cast out of the temple the 
<a name="384"></a>person who gave no assistance to his friend while another was murdering 
<a name="385"></a>him.
<a name="386"></a><br><br><b>33.</b> Immediately prescribe some character and form of conduce 
<a name="387"></a>to yourself, which you may keep both alone and in company.
<a name="388"></a><br><br>Be for the most part silent, or speak merely what is necessary, 
<a name="389"></a>and in few words. We may, however, enter, though sparingly, into discourse 
<a name="390"></a>sometimes when occasion calls for it, but not on any of the common subjects, 
<a name="391"></a>of gladiators, or horse races, or athletic champions, or feasts, the vulgar 
<a name="392"></a>topics of conversation; but principally not of men, so as either to blame, 
<a name="393"></a>or praise, or make comparisons. If you are able, then, by your own conversation 
<a name="394"></a>bring over that of your company to proper subjects; but, if you happen 
<a name="395"></a>to be taken among strangers, be silent.
<a name="396"></a><br><br>Don't allow your laughter be much, nor on many occasions, nor 
<a name="397"></a>profuse.
<a name="398"></a><br><br>Avoid swearing, if possible, altogether; if not, as far as you 
<a name="399"></a>are able.
<a name="400"></a><br><br>Avoid public and vulgar entertainments; but, if ever an occasion 
<a name="401"></a>calls you to them, keep your attention upon the stretch, that you may not 
<a name="402"></a>imperceptibly slide into vulgar manners. For be assured that if a person 
<a name="403"></a>be ever so sound himself, yet, if his companion be infected, he who converses 
<a name="404"></a>with him will be infected likewise.
<a name="405"></a><br><br>Provide things relating to the body no further than mere use; as 
<a name="406"></a>meat, drink, clothing, house, family. But strike off and reject everything 
<a name="407"></a>relating to show and delicacy.
<a name="408"></a><br><br>As far as possible, before marriage, keep yourself pure from familiarities 
<a name="409"></a>with women, and, if you indulge them, let it be lawfully." But don't therefore 
<a name="410"></a>be troublesome and full of reproofs to those who use these liberties, nor 
<a name="411"></a>frequently boast that you yourself don't.
<a name="412"></a><br><br>If anyone tells you that such a person speaks ill of you, don't 
<a name="413"></a>make excuses about what is said of you, but answer: " He does not know 
<a name="414"></a>my other faults, else he would not have mentioned only 
<a name="415"></a>these."
<a name="416"></a><br><br>It is not necessary for you to appear often at public spectacles; 
<a name="417"></a>but if ever there is a proper occasion for you to be there, don't appear 
<a name="418"></a>more solicitous for anyone than for yourself; that is, wish things to be 
<a name="419"></a>only just as they are, and him only to conquer who is the conqueror, for 
<a name="420"></a>thus you will meet with no hindrance. But abstain entirely from declamations 
<a name="421"></a>and derision and violent emotions. And when you come away, don't discourse 
<a name="422"></a>a great deal on what has passed, and what does not contribute to your own 
<a name="423"></a>amendment. For it would appear by such discourse that you were immoderately 
<a name="424"></a>struck with the show.
<a name="425"></a><br><br>Go not [of your own accord] to the rehearsals of any 
<a name="426"></a><br><i>authors</i>
<a name="427"></a>, nor appear [at them] readily. But, if you do appear, keepyour gravity 
<a name="428"></a>and sedateness, and at the same time avoid being morose.
<a name="429"></a><br><br>When you are going to confer with anyone, and particularly of those 
<a name="430"></a>in a superior station, represent to yourself how Socrates or Zeno would 
<a name="431"></a>behave in such a case, and you will not be at a loss to make a proper use 
<a name="432"></a>of whatever may occur.
<a name="433"></a><br><br>When you are going to any of the people in power, represent to 
<a name="434"></a>yourself that you will not find him at home; that you will not be admitted; 
<a name="435"></a>that the doors will not be opened to you; that he will take no notice of 
<a name="436"></a>you. If, with all this, it is your duty to go, bear what happens, and never 
<a name="437"></a>say [to yourself], " It was not worth so much." For this is vulgar, and 
<a name="438"></a>like a man dazed by external things.
<a name="439"></a><br><br>In parties of conversation, avoid a frequent and excessive mention 
<a name="440"></a>of your own actions and dangers. For, however agreeable it may be to yourself 
<a name="441"></a>to mention the risks you have run, it is not equally agreeable to others 
<a name="442"></a>to hear your adventures. Avoid, likewise, an endeavor to excite laughter. 
<a name="443"></a>For this is a slippery point, which may throw you into vulgar manners, 
<a name="444"></a>and, besides, may be apt to lessen you in the esteem of your acquaintance. 
<a name="445"></a>Approaches to indecent discourse are likewise dangerous. Whenever, therefore, 
<a name="446"></a>anything of this sort happens, if there be a proper opportunity, rebuke 
<a name="447"></a>him who makes advances that way; or, at least, by silence and blushing 
<a name="448"></a>and a forbidding look, show yourself to be displeased by such 
<a name="449"></a>talk.
<a name="450"></a><br><br><b>34.</b> If you are struck by the appearance of any promised 
<a name="451"></a>pleasure, guard yourself against being hurried away by it; but let the 
<a name="452"></a>affair wait your leisure, and procure yourself some delay. Then bring to 
<a name="453"></a>your mind both points of time: that in which you will enjoy the pleasure, 
<a name="454"></a>and that in which you will repent and reproach yourself after you have 
<a name="455"></a>enjoyed it; and set before you, in opposition to these, how you will be 
<a name="456"></a>glad and applaud yourself if you abstain. And even though it should appear 
<a name="457"></a>to you a seasonable gratification, take heed that its enticing, and agreeable 
<a name="458"></a>and attractive force may not subdue you; but set in opposition to this 
<a name="459"></a>how much better it is to be conscious of having gained so great a 
<a name="460"></a>victory.
<a name="461"></a><br><br><b>35.</b> When you do anything from a clear judgment that it ought 
<a name="462"></a>to be done, never shun the being seen to do it, even though the world should 
<a name="463"></a>make a wrong supposition about it; for, if you don't act right, shun the 
<a name="464"></a>action itself; but, if you do, why are you afraid of those who censure 
<a name="465"></a>you wrongly?
<a name="466"></a><br><br><b>36.</b> As the proposition, "Either it is day or it is night," 
<a name="467"></a>is extremely proper for a disjunctive argument, but quite improper in a 
<a name="468"></a>conjunctive one, so, at a feast, to choose the largest share is very suitable 
<a name="469"></a>to the bodily appetite, but utterly inconsistent with the social spirit 
<a name="470"></a>of an entertainment. When you eat with another, then, remember not only 
<a name="471"></a>the value of those things which are set before you to the body, but the 
<a name="472"></a>value of that behavior which ought to be observed towards the person who 
<a name="473"></a>gives the entertainment.
<a name="474"></a><br><br><b>37.</b> If you have assumed any character above your strength, 
<a name="475"></a>you have both made an ill figure in that and quitted one which you might 
<a name="476"></a>have supported.
<a name="477"></a><br><br><b>38.</b> When walking, you are careful not to step on a nail 
<a name="478"></a>or turn your foot; so likewise be careful not to hurt the ruling faculty 
<a name="479"></a>of your mind. And, if we were to guard against this in every action, we 
<a name="480"></a>should undertake the action with the greater safety.
<a name="481"></a><br><br><b>39.</b> The body is to everyone the measure of the possessions 
<a name="482"></a>proper for it, just as the foot is of the shoe. If, therefore, you stop 
<a name="483"></a>at this, you will keep the measure; but if you move beyond it, you must 
<a name="484"></a>necessarily be carried forward, as down a cliff; as in the case of a shoe, 
<a name="485"></a>if you go beyond its fitness to the foot, it comes first to be gilded, 
<a name="486"></a>then purple, and then studded with jewels. For to that which once exceeds 
<a name="487"></a>a due measure, there is no bound.
<a name="488"></a><br><br><b>40.</b> Women from fourteen years old are flattered with the 
<a name="489"></a>title of "mistresses" by the men. Therefore, perceiving that they are regarded 
<a name="490"></a>only as qualified to give the men pleasure, they begin to adorn themselves, 
<a name="491"></a>and in that to place ill their hopes. We should, therefore, fix our attention 
<a name="492"></a>on making them sensible that they are valued for the appearance of decent, 
<a name="493"></a>modest and discreet behavior.
<a name="494"></a><br><br><b>41.</b> It is a mark of want of genius to spend much time in 
<a name="495"></a>things relating to the body, as to be long in our exercises, in eating 
<a name="496"></a>and drinking, and in the discharge of other animal functions. These should 
<a name="497"></a>be done incidentally and slightly, and our whole attention be engaged in 
<a name="498"></a>the care of the understanding.
<a name="499"></a><br><br><b>42.</b> When any person harms you, or speaks badly of you, remember 
<a name="500"></a>that he acts or speaks from a supposition of its being his duty. Now, it 
<a name="501"></a>is not possible that he should follow what appears right to you, but what 
<a name="502"></a>appears so to himself. Therefore, if he judges from a wrong appearance, 
<a name="503"></a>he is the person hurt, since he too is the person deceived. For if anyone 
<a name="504"></a>should suppose a true proposition to be false, the proposition is not hurt, 
<a name="505"></a>but he who is deceived about it. Setting out, then, from these principles, 
<a name="506"></a>you will meekly bear a person who reviles you, for you will say upon every 
<a name="507"></a>occasion, "It seemed so to him."
<a name="508"></a><br><br><b>43.</b> Everything has two handles, the one by which it may 
<a name="509"></a>be carried, the other by which it cannot. If your brother acts unjustly, 
<a name="510"></a>don't lay hold on the action by the handle of his injustice, for by that 
<a name="511"></a>it cannot be carried; but by the opposite, that he is your brother, that 
<a name="512"></a>he was brought up with you; and thus you will lay hold on it, as it is 
<a name="513"></a>to be carried.
<a name="514"></a><br><br><b>44.</b> These reasonings are unconnected: "I am richer than 
<a name="515"></a>you, therefore I am better"; "I am more eloquent than you, therefore I 
<a name="516"></a>am better." The connection is rather this: "I am richer than you, therefore 
<a name="517"></a>my property is greater than yours;" "I am more eloquent than you, therefore 
<a name="518"></a>my style is better than yours." But you, after all, are neither property 
<a name="519"></a>nor style.
<a name="520"></a><br><br><b>45.</b> Does anyone bathe in a mighty little time? Don't say 
<a name="521"></a>that he does it ill, but in a mighty little time. Does anyone drink a great 
<a name="522"></a>quantity of wine? Don't say that he does ill, but that he drinks a great 
<a name="523"></a>quantity. For, unless you perfectly understand the principle from which 
<a name="524"></a>anyone acts, how should you know if he acts ill? Thus you will not run 
<a name="525"></a>the hazard of assenting to any appearances but such as you fully 
<a name="526"></a>comprehend.
<a name="527"></a><br><br><b>46.</b> Never call yourself a philosopher, nor talk a great 
<a name="528"></a>deal among the unlearned about theorems, but act conformably to them. Thus, 
<a name="529"></a>at an entertainment, don't talk how persons ought to eat, but eat as you 
<a name="530"></a>ought. For remember that in this manner Socrates also universally avoided 
<a name="531"></a>all ostentation. And when persons came to him and desired to be recommended 
<a name="532"></a>by him to philosophers, he took and- recommended them, so well did he bear 
<a name="533"></a>being overlooked. So that if ever any talk should happen among the unlearned 
<a name="534"></a>concerning philosophic theorems, be you, for the most part, silent. For 
<a name="535"></a>there is great danger in immediately throwing out what you have not digested. 
<a name="536"></a>And, if anyone tells you that you know nothing, and you are not nettled 
<a name="537"></a>at it, then you may be sure that you have begun your business. For sheep 
<a name="538"></a>don't throw up the grass to show the shepherds how much they have eaten; 
<a name="539"></a>but, inwardly digesting their food, they outwardly produce wool and milk. 
<a name="540"></a>Thus, therefore, do you likewise not show theorems to the unlearned, but 
<a name="541"></a>the actions produced by them after they have been digested.
<a name="542"></a><br><br><b>47.</b> When you have brought yourself to supply the necessities 
<a name="543"></a>of your body at a small price, don't pique yourself upon it; nor, if you 
<a name="544"></a>drink water, be saying upon every occasion, "I drink water." But first 
<a name="545"></a>consider how much more sparing and patient of hardship the poor are than 
<a name="546"></a>we. But if at any time you would inure yourself by exercise to labor, and 
<a name="547"></a>bearing hard trials, do it for your own sake, and not for the world; don't 
<a name="548"></a>grasp statues, but, when you are violently thirsty, take a little cold 
<a name="549"></a>water in your mouth, and spurt it out and tell nobody.
<a name="550"></a><br><br><b>48.</b> The condition and characteristic of a vulgar person, 
<a name="551"></a>is, that he never expects either benefit or hurt from himself, but from 
<a name="552"></a>externals. The condition and characteristic of a philosopher is, that he 
<a name="553"></a>expects all hurt and benefit from himself. The marks of a proficient are, 
<a name="554"></a>that he censures no one, praises no one, blames no one, accuses no one, 
<a name="555"></a>says nothing concerning himself as being anybody, or knowing anything: 
<a name="556"></a>when he is, in any instance, hindered or restrained, he accuses himself; 
<a name="557"></a>and, if he is praised, he secretly laughs at the person who praises him; 
<a name="558"></a>and, if he is censured, he makes no defense. But he goes about with the 
<a name="559"></a>caution of sick or injured people, dreading to move anything that is set 
<a name="560"></a>right, before it is perfectly fixed. He suppresses all desire in himself; 
<a name="561"></a>he transfers his aversion to those things only which thwart the proper 
<a name="562"></a>use of our own faculty of choice; the exertion of his active powers towards 
<a name="563"></a>anything is very gentle; if he appears stupid or ignorant, he does not 
<a name="564"></a>care, and, in a word, he watches himself as an enemy, and one in 
<a name="565"></a>ambush.
<a name="566"></a><br><br><b>49.</b> When anyone shows himself overly confident in ability 
<a name="567"></a>to understand and interpret the works of Chrysippus, say to yourself, " 
<a name="568"></a>Unless Chrysippus had written obscurely, this person would have had no 
<a name="569"></a>subject for his vanity. But what do I desire? To understand nature and 
<a name="570"></a>follow her. I ask, then, who interprets her, and, finding Chrysippus does, 
<a name="571"></a>I have recourse to him. I don't understand his writings. I seek, therefore, 
<a name="572"></a>one to interpret them." So far there is nothing to value myself upon. And 
<a name="573"></a>when I find an interpreter, what remains is to make use of his instructions. 
<a name="574"></a>This alone is the valuable thing. But, if I admire nothing but merely the 
<a name="575"></a>interpretation, what do I become more than a grammarian instead of a philosopher? 
<a name="576"></a>Except, indeed, that instead of Homer I interpret Chrysippus. When anyone, 
<a name="577"></a>therefore, desires me to read Chrysippus to him, I rather blush when I 
<a name="578"></a>cannot show my actions agreeable and consonant to his 
<a name="579"></a>discourse.
<a name="580"></a><br><br><b>50.</b> Whatever moral rules you have deliberately proposed 
<a name="581"></a>to yourself. abide by them as they were laws, and as if you would be guilty 
<a name="582"></a>of impiety by violating any of them. Don't regard what anyone says of you, 
<a name="583"></a>for this, after all, is no concern of yours. How long, then, will you put 
<a name="584"></a>off thinking yourself worthy of the highest improvements and follow the 
<a name="585"></a>distinctions of reason? You have received the philosophical theorems, with 
<a name="586"></a>which you ought to be familiar, and you have been familiar with them. What 
<a name="587"></a>other master, then, do you wait for, to throw upon that the delay of reforming 
<a name="588"></a>yourself? You are no longer a boy, but a grown man. If, therefore, you 
<a name="589"></a>will be negligent and slothful, and always add procrastination to procrastination, 
<a name="590"></a>purpose to purpose, and fix day after day in which you will attend to yourself, 
<a name="591"></a>you will insensibly continue without proficiency, and, living and dying, 
<a name="592"></a>persevere in being one of the vulgar. This instant, then, think yourself 
<a name="593"></a>worthy of living as a man grown up, and a proficient. Let whatever appears 
<a name="594"></a>to be the best be to you an inviolable law. And if any instance of pain 
<a name="595"></a>or pleasure, or glory or disgrace, is set before you, remember that now 
<a name="596"></a>is the combat, now the Olympiad comes on, nor can it be put off. By once 
<a name="597"></a>being defeated and giving way, proficiency is lost, or by the contrary 
<a name="598"></a>preserved. Thus Socrates became perfect, improving himself by everything. 
<a name="599"></a>attending to nothing but reason. And though you are not yet a Socrates, 
<a name="600"></a>you ought, however, to live as one desirous of becoming a 
<a name="601"></a>Socrates.
<a name="602"></a><br><br><b>51.</b> The first and most necessary topic in philosophy is 
<a name="603"></a>that of the use of moral theorems, such as, "We ought not to lie;" the 
<a name="604"></a>second is that of demonstrations, such as, "What is the origin of our obligation 
<a name="605"></a>not to lie;" the third gives strength and articulation to the other two, 
<a name="606"></a>such as, "What is the origin of this is a demonstration." For what is demonstration? 
<a name="607"></a>What is consequence? What contradiction? What truth? What falsehood? The 
<a name="608"></a>third topic, then, is necessary on the account of the second, and the second 
<a name="609"></a>on the account of the first. But the most necessary, and that whereon we 
<a name="610"></a>ought to rest, is the first. But we act just on the contrary. For we spend 
<a name="611"></a>all our time on the third topic, and employ all our diligence about that, 
<a name="612"></a>and entirely neglect the first. Therefore, at the same time that we lie, 
<a name="613"></a>we are immediately prepared to show how it is demonstrated that lying is 
<a name="614"></a>not right.
<a name="615"></a><br><br><b>52.</b> Upon all occasions we ought to have these maxims ready 
<a name="616"></a>at hand:
<a name="617"></a><br><br>"Conduct me, Jove, and you, 0 Destiny,
<a name="618"></a><br>Wherever your decrees have fixed my station." <br><i>Cleanthes</i>

<a name="619"></a><br><br>"I follow cheerfully; and, did I not,
<a name="620"></a><br>Wicked and wretched, I must follow still
<a name="621"></a><br>Whoever yields properly to Fate, is deemed
<a name="622"></a><br>Wise among men, and knows the laws of heaven." <br><i>Euripides, Frag. 
<a name="623"></a>965</i>

<a name="624"></a><br><br>And this third:
<a name="625"></a><br><br>"0 Crito, if it thus pleases the gods, thus let it be. Anytus and 
<a name="626"></a>Melitus may kill me indeed, but hurt me they cannot." <br><i>Plato's Crito 
<a name="627"></a>and Apology</i>
